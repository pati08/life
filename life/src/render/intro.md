# About
Hello, welcome to **John Conway's Game of Life**, a classic cellular automata game. It plays out on a 2D infinite grid of cells that are each either alive or dead, based on the following rules:

- If a cell is alive and has 2 or 3 living neighbors, it lives on.
- If a cell is dead and has exactly 3 living neighbors, it comes to life.
- If a cell is alive and has either less than 2 or more than 3 living neighbors, it dies.

# Controls
This implementation of the Game is controlled as follows:
- Right mouse button and drag to pan
- Scroll to zoom
- Space to toggle playing
- Click to toggle a cell

# Menus
You can also use the on-screen menus to change some options and view some information. The following menus are available:
- A bar on the top with some basic game controls
- A "Statisitcs" window showing important information about the game
- A menu to save and load games (desktop only)
